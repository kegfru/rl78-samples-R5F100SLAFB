These are simple applications showing usage of different parts and
capabilities of Renesas RL78 MCUs.

These samples were tested on QB-R5F100SL-TB CPU board
populated with R5F100SLAFB MCU, but must run on other RL78 parts
without or with little changes.

RL78-ELF-GCC toolchain can be downloaded from KPIT GNU Tools web site:
